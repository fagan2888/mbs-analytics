Recommend features to work on include anything in the `To-Do List` section of the `README`. Some general themes of underdeveloped areas include:

- Enhancement of the library methods exposed by api.cpp/api.h. There are more variants of common functionality that may be useful to include there.
- Prototype a high-level language interface, either by extending the existing C# interface located in src/frontend or adding another language. Python and node.js are probably two good ideas. Longer term, I may spend some effort myself developing a full JS-based web frontend for this engine.
